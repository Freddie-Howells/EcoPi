#EcoPi Project

This is a project to reduce energy consumption by monitoring the temperature of my house every 20 minutes and then tweeting me if the temperature rises above 22 degrees or drops below 17 degrees, asking me if I would like to turn the heating on or off. By remotely connecting to my Raspberry Pi via SSH on my mobile phone I can then turn our heating on or off by transmitting a wav file by a 433MHz transmitter
